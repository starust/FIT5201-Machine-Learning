    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we practice how to\n",
    "\n",
    "- create arrays objects in various ways including sampling random data with `numpy.random`\n",
    "- apply operations to arrays\n",
    "- select parts of an array via indexing\n",

    "- Python set up on your system to run Jupyter Notebooks and the libraries installed that are specified in `requirements.txt`\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit we are mainly going to work with the following Python libraries:\n",
    "1. `numpy` for numerical computations\n",
    "2. `scipy` for some advanced scientific computing methods (not often)\n",
    "3. `matplotlib` for plotting data\n",
    "4. `scikit-learn` for machine learning tools\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries build on each other (in the order listed) and the first three are often jointly referred to as \"the scipy-stack\". Those three are very important in the professional and academic practice of Python programming with `numpy` being the fundamental basis for writing efficient Python code. \n",
